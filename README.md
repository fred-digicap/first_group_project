# first_group_project
This python program is designed to aid an employee of a consulting business where he is paid based on the number of hours 
and minutes he works on client projects.

He needs a time tracking program, where he enters the date and the time he started working on a task, and then the date
and time when he finished a particular task.

The program calculates the hours he spent on a task. It then calculates the amount of money the employee made tackling the task.

The employee should be able to track time spent and money earned on both old and on-going projects.

The employee is paid $5 dollars per hour; thus, $0.083 per minute

In summary, this program would:

· help the employee track his money.

· calculate the hours he spent on a task.

· calculate the amount of money the employee made tackling the task.


To conclude, time entered and information from the program is stored in a csv or excel file for future referencing.

*There is the need to import the datetime module since date and time calculation is involved in the program.
*Also, there is the need to import the csv module which contains objects and other code to read, write, and process 
 sdata from and to CSV files


NB:
The python file and excel csv file are all placed in the same folder for faster referencing
